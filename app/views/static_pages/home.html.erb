<strong>PROBLEM: </strong>Joe wants to sell his used bike. But selling a used bike on Craigslist is a pain in the a...... multiple emails, negotiations, meeting strangers at your door....
</p>
<br>
<strong>SOLUTION:</strong> ReRide. 
<br>
<br>
<p class="text-left">
<strong>STEP 1:</strong> Joe goes to www.reridebikes.com.  Finds his used bicycle in our database and receives an immediate quote for how much money we will give him for his bike.  
<br>
<strong>STEP 2:</strong> Joe chooses a bike shop in his area that is partnered with ReRide. Joe takes his bike to the bike shop. 
<br>
<strong>STEP 3:</strong> Joe's bike is inspected at the bike shop and Joe is then approved for payment.  Joe leaves his bike at the bike shop and gets money in his pocket!
<br>
<strong>STEP 4:</strong> ReRide and its partner bike shops help find Joe's bike a new owner and his bike lives to ride another day! 
<br>
</p>
All is right in the world.</h2>
